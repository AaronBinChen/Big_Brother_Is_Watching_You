<p>
    This is a continuation of our hackathon project (original on Chuwei's Repo) so it's a downloadable software package.
</p>

## Running the software
The app uses Flask, OpenCv, and MatPlotLib. First download these requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

if on Mac or Linux run the following to run the app:
```
export FLASK_APP=app.py
flask run
```

If on Windows run the following
```
set FLASK_APP = app
flask run
```

enjoy!


<h1> Objective </h1>
<p>
    This project was done for the Hack in Place Hackathon. There were four challenges available: Home, Economy, Health, and Education.
</p>

<h2> Description of the four challenges: </h2>
<h3> Home </h3>
<p>
    2020 saw record-breaking wildfires, heatwaves, hurricanes, and floods. The increasing severity of natural disasters is just one facet through which climate chnage is affecting our one home - planet earth. 

    Team Challenge: Create innovative solutions that help individuals reduce their carbon footprint, and become more resilient to changes in the environment. 
</p>

<h3> Economy </h3>
<p>
    Extended shelter-in-place restrictions, necessitated by the pandemic, have led to significant financial losses for most small and medium-sized businesses, forcing many to permanently close down altogether. 

    Team Challenge: Design resourceful methods to help local businesses connect and engage with consumers in the COVID era. 
</p>

<h3> Health </h3>
<p>
    Even with the ongoing vaccine rollout, the COVID pandemic is still a huge health risk both to us and our communities.

    Team Challenge: Find creative ways for people to stay resilient and healthy both mentally and physically while sheltering in place.
</p>

<h3> Education </h3>
<p>
    Systems of education are always evolving, but last year we saw drastic changes in how we learn. While we’ve made good progress in transitioning to online learning, there still remains much to be done in this space.

    Team Challenge: Find ways that we can improve the virtual learning experience for learners and instructors
</p>

<h3> Team Choice </h3>
<p> 
    Our team was originally stuck between the theme of Education and Home. Specifically, the issues of climate change and carbon footprint tracking from Home and the anti-cheating mechanism for Education. We ultimately elected to pursue the theme of Education. During the COVID pandemic and the transition to online learning, there has been an increase in academic dishonesty accusations and cheating. But, this already has a solution technologically with lockdown browsers and proctoring during live exams. However, the biggest issue of the COVID pandemic was the difficulty transitioning from a physical classroom experience to a fully online classroom experience.
</p>

<p>
    Many professors noted that their students did worse during the online setting. In addition, many teachers were not able to fully gauge their student's level of understanding of the material. This can perhaps be due to a lack of attention during class time.
</p>

<p>
    Our prototype can serve as an additional feature on Zoom, where student's eyes are tracked. If they look away, it will be flagged; perhaps, the professor can review these moments. This allows the professor to understand when students lose focus and what material should potentially be reviewed in the coming days. 
</p>

<h3> Pupil Tracking </h3>

<b>Possible Introduction<b>: Hello everyone! Today, we will be giving a short demo on our project done for the Hack In Place 2021 Hackathon Theme of Education. During the transition to online learning, many professors have noticed that their students are doing worse online. In addition, many teachers are not not able to fully gauge their student's level of understanding remotely. This project serves as an potential solution to the mentioned problems. 
 
Our software will use existing face_cascade and eye_cascade classifiers to identify student faces and eyes. When we detect faces, the faces object is an array with potential sub-arrays consisting of four numbers: X, Y, width, and height of the detected face. We will draw a rectangle with the following information to denote

We will detect eyes the same way. The eyes object is just like faces object — it contains X, Y, width and height of the eyes’ frames. When a face is detected, the algorithm searches for eyes on the top half of the face region of interest.  This reduces chances of mismatching the mouth as an eye. However it can be reversed if we receive complaints about discriminating against people with enormous foreheads.

After eyes are located in the top half of the face, The algorithm divides the face into left and right sections to separate the right and left eye. (Left and right is subjective here). We will then draw rectangles to denote the detected eyes.

Once the eyes are located, the pupil’s location will be located with the use of blob-detection algorithms. We know that the pupil is always the darkest part of the eye so we’ll set a threshold to filter out regions of non-interest. We will then be left with only the pupils and then collect the coordinates of the pupils. Average it out over 30 tick intervals and determine if the student is currently on task or not.
